FK_HOURS_PLAYED
===============

Minecraft Plugin to measure players time for ranking

Due to the new EULA from Mojang, Future Kingdoms Minecraft Community
is forced to use hours played by the members to be able to determine whenh they can gain any cosmetic changes.

Future Kingdoms have tried numerous Plugins which are available through Bukkit, but they do not suit the needs nor the 
requirments needed by the server nor the players on the Future Kingdoms Minecraft Server.
